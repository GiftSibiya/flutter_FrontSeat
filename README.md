# Mobile Taxi Math (Front Seat)

If you've seen the web version of this application [here](https://giftsibiya.github.io/TaxiMaths/), this is the mobile application made using the Flutter framework. It has undergone some style changes to better suit the mobile aesthetic. Although it functions the same way, I am still working on adding multi-fare support.

Feel free to visit my LinkedIn or TikTok to see it in action.

## Made with ❤️ in:
- **Dart**
- **Flutter**
- **Android Studio**

I quickly adapted to using a new framework and a new language to transfer this to mobile, as Flutter is quite different from HTML. After about a week of grappling with widgets, I got the hang of it and started becoming accustomed to the ways of Dart and Flutter, loving its similarity to C++.

## Optimizations

One of the key improvements from the web version was enhancing the modularity of the code. Flutter allowed me to create classes for all the components/widgets I wanted to add, resulting in a much cleaner codebase compared to the web version. Styling was improved to be theme-adaptable and stylish.

## Lessons Learned

There's always a better way of doing things. The urge to keep learning and improving will have you leveling up your skills in a way no teacher can teach. Getting your fingers in the code and fixing bugs is one of the best teachers out there.
