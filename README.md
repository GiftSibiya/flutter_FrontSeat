# Web taxi math

If you've seen the web version of this application [here](https://giftsibiya.github.io/TaxiMaths/), this is the mobile application made using the flutter framework. This recieved some sytle changes to better suite the mobile aesthetic. Works the same way however i'm still to add multi-fare support.
You can visit my linkedIn or TikTok to see it in action.

## Made with love in:
**Dart** ,
**Flutter** ,
**Android Sttudio**

I quickly had  to adapt to using a new framwork and a new language to transfer this to mobile as flutter is largely different from HTML. After about a week of fihtung with widgets i got the hang of it and started gettign accustomed to the ways of dart and flutter and loved it's similarity to C++ 

## Optimizations

Much of the things i wanted to fix in the web version was the non modulariy of the code. Flutter allowed me to create classes for all the components / widgets i wanted to add making this a much cleaner codebase compared to the web version. Styling was improved to be theme adaptable and stylish.

## Lessons Learned:
There's always a better way of doing thing. The urge to keep learning and improving will have you leveling up your skill in a way no teacher can teach. Getting your fingers in the code and fixing bugs is on of the best teachers out there.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
